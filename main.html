	<summary>Billu has mentioned to his family that he knows Sahir from the past but has never elaborated how he knows the star. <br> When his children talk about their father's friendship with the star, word spreads throughout the village. Virtually overnight, <br> Billu, who had previously been scorned by most due to his lowly state, becomes the center of attention. People who had spurned <br> him only the week before now call him a close friend so that he will introduce them to Sahir. Billu refuses and downplays the <br> friendship. Even so, the powerful businessman Sahukaar Daamchand (Om Puri) demands to see Sahir and offers Billu expensive gifts <br> in order to gain such a meeting. When Billu consistently fails to introduce the people of the village to Sahir, his situation <br> changes once again. He is accused of lying about his friendship and everyone – including his wife and children – begins to doubt <br> his character and integrity. Rather than defend himself, Billu remains quiet about the nature <br> of his and Sahir's friendship.</summary>
